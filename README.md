## Project Status

`v0.0.0` is released!

**v0.0.0**
- variable initialization and assignment
- arithmetic and boolean operators, type casting
- bool, char, int, float, str, arrays (including multi-dimensional arrays)
- conditionals (if, elif and else statements)
- for & while loops
- functions (including recursion)

I have already planned future functionality, including pointers, OOP, modules, and a standard library.

## Usage

You will need a Night binary file, and a source file with Night code. To run the source file, simply type

```
night source.night
```

Try it out now with this simple Night code!

> source.night
```py
# recursive fib function
def fib(n int) int
{
	if (n == 0 || n == 1)
		return n;

	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

print("Enter a number: ");
n int = int(input());

for (i int = 0; i < n; i += 1)
	print(str(fib(i)) + " ");
```

Binary files can be found under releases, or compiled manually as shown in the [Build](#build) section.

`tests/programs/` contain simple example programs written in Night to solve various online computer science problem sets, including [`cs50`](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2023/spring/). These programs are also used for functional testing.

## Build

**Windows Build:**

The following is intructions on how to build from source. If you want download the exe file, head over to the releases section.

Dependenies

`cmake` `g++`

First, clone the repo and move into that directory. Generate MinGW Makefiles using `cmake`, and then build. You should then see a `night.exe` file in the current directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/alex/apostolu/night.git
cd night

cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .
cmake --build .

night source.night
```

**Linux Build:**

First, clone the repo and move into that directory. Generate Unix Makefiles using `cmake`, and then build. You should then see a `night` binary in the current directory.

```
cd night

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
cmake --build .

./night source.night
```

`source.night` is a generic path name to your source file
