# Tests

This directory current contains a bash script to run integrated tests for Night. The integrated tests come in the form of sample programs in the `Programs/` directory.

I have solved some problems from Harvard's CS50 course using Night, and they are in `Programs/cs50`. I have also include some mathematical programs in `Programs/math` with the help from my sister!
